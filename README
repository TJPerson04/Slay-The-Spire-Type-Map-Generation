This is a project to create a randomized map for a D&D campaign I plan to run based off of Slay the Spire, Inscryption Act 1, and similar deck building rouge-like games.

To run: 
1) Download the code
2) Build the project using nodejs (`npm i` in the terminal)
3) Run index.js (`node index.js`)
4) If an error occurs saying "Cannot use import statement outside a module," add `"type": "module",` to your package.json file.
